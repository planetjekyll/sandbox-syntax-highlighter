title: Code Blocks in Lists or Nested Lists

<!-- update:
   try without indentation (or less than 4 e.g. max 3)
   -->


## Fenced code blocks inside ordered and unordered lists

1. This is a numbered list.
2. I'm going to include a fenced code block as part of this bullet:

```
Code
More Code
```

3. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
   1. Like this:

```c
printf("Hello, World!");
```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block by **(4 * bullet_indent_level)** spaces.
   3. Also need to put a separating newline above and below the fenced block.

## Failed attempts:

1. This is a bullet.
2. This is the end of the first bullet list, with a fenced code block following:

```
Code
More Code
```

3. This is the start of a new bullet list. Hey, where is my fenced code?

```
Code
More Code
```

4. Maybe we can do it with indenting?

    Code
    More Code

5. Did that work? No, so we will try with separation:

    Code
    More Code

6. Now I will try more indenting, to match the bullet margin, plus 4:

       Code
       More Code

7.  Well that was disappointing. How about we indent and use backticks together?

       ```
       Code
       More Code
       ```
8. No such luck.

* Oh look, it's some [Apache config](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/#lexers-for-non-source-code-file-types):

    ```apache
    <Directory /foo/bar>
      Order allow,deny
      Deny from all
    </Directory>
    ```

* Wasn't that fun?
